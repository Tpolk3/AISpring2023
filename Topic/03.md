## Agents that Plan

![agent-plans](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/agent-plans.png)

- **Theme**
  - Goal determination
  - Mathematical abstraction to formalize goal
  - Algorithms that operate on abstraction

### Reflex Agents

![agent-reflex](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/agent-reflex.png)

- Choose action based on current percept
- May have memory or a model of the worldâ€™s current state
- Do not consider the future consequences of their actions
- Consider how the world **is**
- Example
  - Eye blinking
  - Vacuum cleaner moving towards nearest dirt
- Can a reflex agent be rational?

**Demonstration: Pac-Man Optimal Reflex**

**Demonstration: Pac-Man Odd Reflex**

### Planning Agents

![agent-plan](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/agent-plan.png)

- Ask *what if*
- Decisions based on (hypothesized) consequences of actions
- Must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actions
- Must formulate a goal (test)
- Consider how the world **would be**
- Optimal vs. complete planning
- Planning vs. replanning

**Demonstration: Pac-Man Replanning**

**Demonstration: Pac-Man Mastermind**
