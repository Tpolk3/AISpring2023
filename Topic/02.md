# AI Science Evolution

* Think rationally (problems with scale)
* Think like people (problems with reverse engineering)
* Act like people (problems with accuracy - turing test)
* Act rationaly (modern approach - build a system that acts optimally)

## What About the Brain?

![ai-brain](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/ai-brain.png)

* Human brains are very good at making rational decisions, but not perfect.
* Brains aren’t as modular as software which makes them hard to reverse engineer.
* “Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight” (Humans didn't need to flap wings to fly)
* Lessons learned from the brain: memory and simulation are key to decision making

## Rational Decisions

The term **rational** used in a specific, technical way.

* Rational is maximally achieving pre-defined goals.
* Rationality only concerns what decisions are made and not the thought process behind them.
* Goals are expressed in terms of the **utility** of outcomes.
* Being rational means **maximizing your expected utility**
* AI = Computational Rationality

## Maximize Your Expected Utility

![expected-utility](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/expected-utility.png)

* What are we trying to achieve (i.e. utility)?
* What algorithms are involved to obtain an optimal result for utility?
* The question being asked for all the problems in this course.

# Intelligent Agents

## Designing Rational Agents

* An **agent** is an entity that *perceives* and *acts*.
* A **rational agent** selects actions that maximize its (expected) **utility**.
* Characteristics of the *percepts*, *environment*, and *action space* dictate techniques for selecting rational actions.
* This course is about
  * General AI techniques for a variety of problem types
  * Learning to recognize when and how a new problem can be solved with an existing technique
