* What is artificial intelligence?
* What can AI do?
  * What should we worry about?
  * What can we do about those things?
  * What should we not worry about?
* What is this course?

## Sci-Fi AI?

## Real-World AI?

## Rational Decisions

The term **rational** used in a specific, technical way.

* Rational is maximally achieving pre-defined goals.
* Rationality only concerns what decisions are made and not the thought process behind them.
* Goals are expressed in terms of the **utility** of outcomes.
* Being rational means **maximizing your expected utility**
* AI = Computational Rationality

## Maximize Your Expected Utility

## What About the Brain?

* Human brains are very good at making rational decisions, but not perfect.
* Brains aren’t as modular as software which makes them hard to reverse engineer.
* “Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight”
* Lessons learned from the brain: memory and simulation are key to decision making

## A Brief History of AI

![ai-history](https://github.com/btdobbs/COSC-440/blob/main/Topic/images/ai-history.png)

* 1940-1950: Early days
  * 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain
  * 1950: Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”
* 1950—70: Excitement
  * 1950s: Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist, Gelernter's Geometry Engine
  * 1956: Dartmouth meeting: “Artificial Intelligence” adopted
  * 1965: Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning
* 1970—90: Knowledge-based approaches
  * 1969—79: Early development of knowledge-based systems
  * 1980—88: Expert systems industry booms
  * 1988—93: Expert systems industry busts: “AI Winter”
* 1990—: Statistical approaches
  * Resurgence of probability, focus on uncertainty
  * General increase in technical depth
  * Agents and learning systems... “AI Spring”?
  * 1996: Kasparov defeats Deep Blue at chess
  * 1997: Deep Blue defeats Kasparov at chess

“I could feel --- I could smell --- a new kind of intelligence across the table.” ~Kasparov

* 2000—: Where are we now?
  * Big data, big compute, neural networks
  * Some re-unification of sub-fields
  * AI used in many industries
  * Chess engines running on ordinary laptops can defeat the world’s best chess players

## Unintentionally Funny Stories

![story](https://github.com/btdobbs/COSC-440/blob/main/Topic/images/story.png)

* One day Joe Bear was hungry. He asked his friend Irving Bird where some honey was. Irving told him there was a beehive in the oak tree. Joe walked to the oak tree. He ate the beehive. The End.
* Henry Squirrel was thirsty. He walked over to the river bank where his good friend Bill Bird was sitting. Henry slipped and fell in the river. Gravity drowned. The End.
* Once upon a time there was a dishonest fox and a vain crow. One day the crow was sitting in his tree, holding a piece of cheese in his mouth. He noticed that he was holding the piece of cheese. He became hungry, and swallowed the cheese. The fox walked over to the crow. The End.

## Designing Rational Agents

![rational-agent](https://github.com/btdobbs/COSC-440/blob/main/Topic/images/rational-agent.png)

* An **agent** is an entity that perceives and acts.
* A **rational agent** selects actions that maximize its (expected) **utility**.
* Characteristics of the *percepts*, *environment*, and *action space* dictate techniques for selecting rational actions.
* This course is about
  * General AI techniques for a variety of problem types
  * Learning to recognize when and how a new problem can be solved with an existing technique
