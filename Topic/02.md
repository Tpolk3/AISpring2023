## What About the Brain?

* Human brains are very good at making rational decisions, but not perfect.
* Brains aren’t as modular as software which makes them hard to reverse engineer.
* “Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight”
* Lessons learned from the brain: memory and simulation are key to decision making

## Designing Rational Agents

![rational-agent](https://github.com/btdobbs/COSC-440/blob/main/Topic/images/rational-agent.png)

* An **agent** is an entity that perceives and acts.
* A **rational agent** selects actions that maximize its (expected) **utility**.
* Characteristics of the *percepts*, *environment*, and *action space* dictate techniques for selecting rational actions.
* This course is about
  * General AI techniques for a variety of problem types
  * Learning to recognize when and how a new problem can be solved with an existing technique
