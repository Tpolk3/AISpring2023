## Unintentionally Funny Stories

![story](https://github.com/btdobbs/AI/blob/main/Topic/images/story.png)

- Shank, Tale-Spin Ssytem (1984)
  - One day Joe Bear was hungry. He asked his friend Irving Bird where some honey was. Irving told him there was a beehive in the oak tree. Joe walked to the oak tree. He ate the beehive. The End.
  - Henry Squirrel was thirsty. He walked over to the river bank where his good friend Bill Bird was sitting. Henry slipped and fell in the river. Gravity drowned. The End.
  - Once upon a time there was a dishonest fox and a vain crow. One day the crow was sitting in his tree, holding a piece of cheese in his mouth. He noticed that he was holding the piece of cheese. He became hungry, and swallowed the cheese. The fox walked over to the crow. The End.
- Your Device
  - Hey Alexa/Hey Cortana/Hey Siri/OK Google "Tell me a story"

# Areas of AI
