### AI in Real Life

* There are a lot of exciting things we can do
* There are things we shouldn't do
* Perhaps consequences should be thought through

![ai-history](https://github.com/btdobbs/COSC-440/blob/main/Topic/images/ai-history.png)

* 1940-1950: Early days
  * 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain
  * 1950: Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”
* 1950—70: Excitement
  * 1950s: Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist, Gelernter's Geometry Engine
  * 1956: Dartmouth meeting: “Artificial Intelligence” adopted
  * 1965: Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning
* 1970—90: Knowledge-based approaches
  * 1969—79: Early development of knowledge-based systems
  * 1980—88: Expert systems industry booms
  * 1988—93: Expert systems industry busts: “AI Winter”
* 1990—2012: Statistical approaches
  * Resurgence of probability, focus on uncertainty
  * General increase in technical depth
  * Agents and learning systems... “AI Spring”?
  * 1996: Kasparov defeats Deep Blue at chess
  * 1997: Deep Blue defeats Kasparov at chess

“I could feel --- I could smell --- a new kind of intelligence across the table.” ~Kasparov

* 2012—: Where are we now?
  * Big data, big compute, neural networks
  * Some re-unification of sub-fields
  * AI used in many industries
  * Chess engines running on ordinary laptops can defeat the world’s best chess players

### 2011: IBM’s Watson defeats Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy!

### AI evolved as a science of making machines that

  * Think rationally (problems with scale)
  * Think like people (problems with reverse engineering)
  * Act like people (turing test - problems with accuracy)
  * Act rationaly (modern approach - build a system that acts optimally)

### Rational Decisions

The term **rational** used in a specific, technical way.

* Rational is maximally achieving pre-defined goals.
* Rationality only concerns what decisions are made and not the thought process behind them.
* Goals are expressed in terms of the **utility** of outcomes.
* Being rational means **maximizing your expected utility**
* AI = Computational Rationality
