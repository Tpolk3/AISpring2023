# Practice 0 - Submitting Practice

## Practice Information

* Submit practice as a pdf file via the institution's LMS.
* The due dates for each practice are listed on the syllabus.
* Please follow the [50 foot Policy](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/50ft_policy.pdf) when collaborating on practice.
* To obtain full points for a practice, submit only the file(s) designated under the submission heading.

These questions check your level of mathematical preparedness for this course. You should be able to answer all of these questions with some research. You can check your programming preparedness by doing Project 0.

## Submision

Submit a pdf file with answers to the following questions:

### Question 1 - Probabilistic Inference

Your box of cereal may be a contest winner! It's rattling, which 100% of winningboxes do. Of course 1% of all boxes rattle and only one box in a million is a winner. What is the probabilitythat your box is a winner?

### Question 2 - Events

You are playing a solitaire game in which you are dealt three cards without replacement from a simplified deck of 10 (marked 1 through 10). You win if all your cards are odd or if one of them is a 10. How many winning hands are there if different orders are different hands? What is your chance of winning?

### Question 3 - Expectations

Someone rolls a fair six-sided die and you win points equal to the number shown. What is the expected number of points after one roll? After 2 rolls? After 100 rolls?

### Question 4 - Conditional Probabilities

Which of the following statements are true for all joint distributions over $X$ and $Y$:
1. $P(x,y) = P(x)P(y)$
2. $P(x,y) = P(x|y)P(y)$
3. $P(x,y) = P(x|y)P(y|x)$
4. $P(x) = \sum_y P(x|y)$
5. $P(x) = \sum_y P(x,y)$

### Question 5 - Linear Equations

You know that $x = \frac{1}{2}y + \frac{1}{2}(x+1)$ and $y = \frac{1}{3}y + \frac{1}{3}(x+2)$.  What are $x$ and $y$?

### Question 6 - Logarithms

Which of the following statements are true?
1. $2^{xy} = 2^x2^y$
2. $2^{x+y} = 2^x2^y$
3. $2^{x+y} = 2^x+2^y$
4. $\log{3^x} = \log{3}\log{x}$
5. $\log{3^x} = x\log{3}$
6. $\log{3^x} = 3x$

### Question 7 - Hashing

What critical operation is generally faster in a hashtable than in a linked list, and how fast is it typically in each? When will a hashtable degrade to the speed of a list?

### Question 8 - Induction

Prove by induction that the sum of the first $n$ odd integers is $n^2$
